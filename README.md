Credits and thanks to Vincent Driessen for proposing a robust Gitflow model and also providing an extension, which helps in simplifying workflow for a robust enterprise release management.

Below process is based on Gitflow model proposed by him http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
